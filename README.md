# 2018 SpaceApps Challenge: KASA
## A mobile application to alert and recommend optimal IDP locations based on a number of factors in the event of a crisis.

There is an alarming increase of Internally Displaced People (IDP) population worldwide year after year. A lot of IDPs end up settling in rural areas after a major event or crisis. Our team wanted to help in routing and organizing the flow of IDPs to more well-equipped and accessible locations where they can find quick help.

Our team decided to build a mobile application targeted towards IDPs in Nigeria. Our app has several features which help with the flow of IDPs to major IDP camps located in various regions within Nigeria:

- Alerting system in the event of a natural disaster or other crisis that sends a push notification to potential IDPs with the mobile app downloaded on their phones.
- Maintains a user profile with information that can assist with a more customized and appropriate IDP camp recommendation.
- An advanced scoring system which combines several criteria and data sources to generate a comprehensive, weighted score which determines top universal recommendations for IDP camps.

For future enhancements, we believe it is useful to expose all the APIs to get scoring information and a consolidated criteria for ranking and attribute weights to IDP camps. This mobile application can also be easily extended to support other countries with high populations of IDPs.
